[00:36.84] Is it fate?
[00:40.71] If it's not easy, it must not be
[00:45.15] At that age
[00:48.78] I cherished the flowers beneath my feet
[00:53.43] But then something must have changed in me
[00:57.96] I used to feel so light
[01:01.75] Now I'll try
[01:05.30] I just want time
[01:13.30] 
[01:10.82] Wait again
[01:13.06] I will be much better then
[01:17.17] Holdin' on, I said
[01:21.35] I will be much better then
[01:34.35] 
[01:28.76] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[01:32.70] I'll be alive next year
[01:36.87] I can make something good, oh
[01:41.83] Something good
[01:45.10] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[01:49.37] I'll be alive next year
[01:53.55] I can make something good, oh
[01:58.52] Something good
[02:05.52] 
[02:02.40] Are you close?
[02:06.25] Shouldn't it come to you naturally?
[02:10.12] And everyone knows, oh
[02:14.47] You're losing your gift and it's plain to see
[02:19.12] But then something must have changed in me
[02:23.46] I don't fear it anymore
[02:27.48] Now I'm sure
[02:31.69] I'm sure
[02:35.69] 
[02:35.47] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[02:39.60] I'll be alive next year
[02:43.63] I can make something good, oh
[02:48.71] Something good
[02:52.31] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[02:56.38] I'll be alive next year
[03:00.40] I can make something good, oh
[03:05.45] Something good
[03:12.45] 
[03:26.45] Wait again
[03:28.85] I will be much better then
[03:34.75] And suddenly
[03:37.08] I've restored your faith in me
[03:44.32] Look at the sky
[03:51.82] 
[04:01.02] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[04:05.23] I'll be alive next year
[04:09.48] I can make something good, oh
[04:14.33] Something good
[04:21.33] 
[04:34.41] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[04:38.52] I'll be alive next year
[04:42.73] I can make something good
[04:47.78] Something good
[04:51.07] Look at the sky, I'm still here
[04:55.25] I'll be alive next year
[04:59.59] I can make something good
[05:04.34] Something good
