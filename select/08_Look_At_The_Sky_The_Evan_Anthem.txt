I really just want to leave and drive away
Drive far from this place
Where it seems surreal to even think how great it would be
I need a little bit of time to myself to think things over
I need to know this all will work out i found my weakness
Give yourself a chance to be
Be who you are just be who you are
Just take the time to think of how it's chnaged
Changed so much this far
A new day has come to even think where has the time gone
Give yourself a chnace to breathe
Breathe in the air of the cold night
