The sun's above the dead sea
Drops of water on your face
You are gazing at me
You are gazing at me
Do you feel this place
Do you feel this place

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death

The moon's above the yellow sand
The wind inflates the silence
This love will never end
This love will never end
It's not the violence

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death

Standing in the shadow of a ghost
We have no rights
We have no choice

Standing in the shadow of a ghost
We have no rights
We have no choice

Standing in the shadow of a ghost
We have no rights
We have no choice

Standing in the shadow of a ghost
We have no rights
We have no choice
We have no rights
We have no choice

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death

Look at the sky
And do it again
Don't close your eyes
Don't be restrained

Look at the sky
Take another breath
Don't close your eyes
Choose life or death
